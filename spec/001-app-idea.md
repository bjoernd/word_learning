# Word Learning

## Idea

We are going to build an app that is helping kids learn proper spelling. The
app will manage a database of words. It will use text-to-speech technology to
read individual words. Then underage users will type the respective word into a
text field. They will achieve scores for correct spelling and be able to see
where they made mistakes.
