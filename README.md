# Word Learning

A web application for practicing spelling through listening exercises. The app speaks words aloud and asks you to type what you hear, providing immediate feedback with sound effects and animations.

## Installation

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

### Production Mode

Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

Run the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

The production files are in the `dist` directory and can be deployed to any web server.

**Note:** Do not open `dist/index.html` directly in your browser using `file://` protocol. This will cause CORS errors and the app will not load. Always use a web server (like `npm run preview`) to serve the built files.
